## Project scheme

* `scanner`: The core customization module extends FlowDroid using APIs provided by the Soot framework to perform backward data-flow analysis on variables in logging sites, tracing each variable through its associated functions and recording the propagation path.
* `checker`: The core customization module reads private data identified in logging sites by the LLM, invokes the `scanner` module to retrieve the functions through which the data flows, obtains the corresponding method bodies (Jimple code) as parsed by the FlowDroid framework based on method signatures, and then feeds the method bodies into the LLM to determine whether sanitization operations (e.g., encryption, desensitization, or obfuscation) are applied. This process confirms whether a privacy leakage actually occurs.
* `soot-infoflow`: This is FlowDroid's core data-flow analysis engine, which operates independently of Android. It implements the IFDS/IDE data-flow analysis framework (via Heros) and defines core concepts such as sources, sinks, and taint propagation rules.
* `soot-infoflow-android`: This module is built on top of `soot-infoflow` and is specifically tailored to address the complexities of Android applications. It includes comprehensive modeling of the Android lifecycle, specialized handling of the four main components, support for callback mechanisms, resource access tracking, permission enforcement, and more.
* `soot-infoflow-cmd`: One command-line interface (CLI) is provided to facilitate the execution of FlowDroid.ã€‚
* `soot-infoflow-summaries`: Includes precomputed or configured data flow summaries for common libraries, especially the Android SDK.
